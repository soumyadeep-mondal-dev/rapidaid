# 🚑 RapidAid — Emergency QR Card Generator

**“If someone collapses in public, their phone becomes useless—locked, silent, inaccessible. RapidAid changes that.”**

RapidAid turns any smartphone lock screen into a **life-saving medical ID**, showing essential details even when the phone is locked. It generates a beautifully designed emergency wallpaper containing medical information, responder instructions, and vCard-enabled emergency contacts. One scan of the QR code reveals everything in a clean, structured, universally readable format—**even if the user cannot speak for themselves.**

## 🌟 Why RapidAid Matters (Story + Impact)

During emergencies, **seconds matter**. When someone is unconscious or disoriented, responders have no access to their medical history, allergies, or emergency contacts. Phones stay locked, apps require permission, and precious time is lost.

**RapidAid solves this by bringing critical information to the surface.**

Your lock screen becomes a **silent first responder**:
- Shows essential medical details at a glance  
- Can be scanned instantly  
- Works on every phone, every OS  
- No installation, no unlock, no app, no backend  

A single scan reveals user-friendly, structured emergency information with the ability to **import contacts directly** using vCards.
